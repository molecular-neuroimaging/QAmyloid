# Q-Amyloid-

The ultimate goal of Q Amyloid is not to introduce new biological findings, but to democratise access to clinical centres by providing a scalable, transparent, and validated methodological tool for quantitative Aβ imaging. In doing so, it aims to support the development of Aβ-targeting therapies and enhance patient monitoring across research and routine clinical practice.
